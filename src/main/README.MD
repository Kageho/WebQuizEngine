## General info

It's my first RESTful Web Service. I got familiar with Spring Boot, Spring Security, H2, JPA, REST. The user can
register, create and solve quizzes. The project has basic authentication. All data is stored in a database. This project
has certainly helped me push past my limit.

## Examples

1. Register a user

2. A wrong registration (the password is too short)
